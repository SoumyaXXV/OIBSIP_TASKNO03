## Simple ATM Interface in Java
This Java program implements a straightforward ATM interface where users can log in, perform basic banking transactions, and view their transaction history. Users can log in with their full name, account number, username, and password. The available actions include withdrawing funds, depositing money, transferring to another account, checking the account balance, and reviewing transaction history. The program maintains transaction records and ensures users cannot withdraw more money than they have in their account. The interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with the ATM system. You can easily run this program in your Java environment to explore its functionality and make modifications as needed.
